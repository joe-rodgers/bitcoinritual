# Ritual Ceremonies
The Bitcoin Maximalism ritual is based on a three level, or three block initiation system. The ritual dramas that make the three ceremonies of Bitcoin Maximalism are part of a single initiation, as only after completing the three blocks does an initiate become a Master Maximalist. 

Maximalist ritual should not replace but rather compliment religion, however religion is not a prerequisite for Maximalism. It is clear that Maximalism is dedicated to teaching the Bitcoin disciplines and upholding the three pillars of Enlightenment, Sovereignty, and Service.
