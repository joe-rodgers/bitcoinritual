# The Bitcoin Ritual

## Editorial Note

This is a working document and an attempt to put a foundation in place for a Bitcoin Ritual. I believe the many disciplines of Bitcoin tend to make a better men. In my personal experience with fraternities, I've found that they are built on belief systems not too different from that of Bitcoiners, however fraternities operate in the shadows, while Bitcoin is light itself. Bitcoin operates for all to see, and so too shall the ritual be. 

The ritual is voluntary. It will be free and open source. It can and will be forked. 

I believe the Bitcoin Ritual will be a [framework](https://github.com/joe-rodgers/bitcoinritual/blob/master/ceremonies.md) for personal and group betterment through education, sovereignty, and service.

## The Three Pillars of Bitcoin
The Bitcoin Ritual is built upon the three pillars of Enlightenment, Sovereignty, and Service. We will find morals and virtue within each pillar.

### Enlightenment
Enlightenment is the pursuit of light. Many great men, who were also Bitcoiners, show clearly that they were, above all, in constant pursuit of light. As an example we can remember Hal Finney who first sought out and first ran a node, which laid the groundwork for the Bitcoin Revolution. 

Enlightenment, in short, means the constant search of knowledge and a better understanding in the views of others. Enlightenmnet implies bringing changes towards oneself that is noble and true in economics, politics, and moral or in the social life. 

### Sovereignty
The choice to declare one's sovereignty is a central point of the Bitcoin ritual which is not surprising due to its symbolism. It is easy to use sovereignty as the moral creation of the individual, moral aims of Bitcoin, and a universal symbol of building the spiritual citadel within.

The tools of Bitcoiners, too, symbolise the qualities essential to the perfection of the inner citadel, as these tools have been used to build a more free and just society. Citadels are built with tools of beauty, balanced by mathematics and personal responsibility. Their functions are freely shared with all who care to review the source code in order to foster peer review and further development of the tools themselves. 

### Service
Service, the third pillar of the Bitcoin Ritual, represents the duty and obligation that every Bitcoiner should manifest in himself and every part of his life. Before service, man must both enlighten and declare his sovereignty, for you must take care of yourself before you are able to serve others. Service is symbolic to the Bitcoin ritual in many ways, but none more than running a full node. There is nothing more pure than participation and preservation of the Bitcoin network. The act of serving others through maintaining a node is moral and just. 

Nothing better illustrates the high moral values of the Bitcoin Ritual than the act of serving. Onboarding, assisting the helpless, and running code are of the highest esteem. 

## Closing Thoughts
As one voluntarily receives the Bitcoin Ritual through initiation, he will emerge with an existential change in his understanding of himself and the world around him. 

The rituals that constitute the three ceremonies of Bitcoin are part of a single initiation, as only after completing the three degrees does an initiate become a full Master Node. It is also clear that the ritual is more moral than religious as Bitcoin is not a religion, even if it has religious basis, but a fraternity dedicated to teaching social concepts and promoting the three pillars of enlightenment, sovereignty and service. 
 
Bitcoin and its principles are a means of transcending social, political and religious divisions and lead to voluntary cooperation.
